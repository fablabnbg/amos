# AMOS
Automatic Mate Ordering System

It is the most important task for every hackspace to never ever EVER!!1 run out of Mate. To prevent chaos, blood and thunder AMOS helps you to keep track of your beverage supply at all time using cheap chinese 50kg load cells, HX711 and a RasPi to weigh the crates.

Development will take place in three stages:

1) Build hardware, read data and publish it using MQTT

2) Improve system to the point where it can predict stock and place orders with the supplier

3) Be immer vor Chef in Geschäft and order Mate schweißfrei.
